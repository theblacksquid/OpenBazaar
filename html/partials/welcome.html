        OpenBazaar is in beta. What this means for you:
        <ul>
            <li>You are <strong>not anonymous at all</strong> on the OpenBazaar network. Your IP is tied to contracts you sell, buy, or notarize. Malicious parties could use this information against you; protecting your privacy is your own responsibility.</li>
            <li>Transactions may fail for technical reasons, and <strong>you can lose your bitcoins</strong>. In early beta we recommend smaller transactions. The OpenBazaar dev team is not responsible for any lost Bitcoin or product issues.</li>
            <li>The software functionality will change over time. This means that <strong>you may lose your product listings</strong> or settings when we roll out new releases.</li>
            <li>Proof-of-burn address format will change, and <strong>reputation pledges will be lost</strong>. Don't pledge too much on your stores yet!</li>
            <li>There will be bugs. Submit a bug report in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenBazaar">Reddit</a> or on Github, and please be patient.</li>
        </ul>
